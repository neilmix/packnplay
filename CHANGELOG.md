## [v1.0.0] - 2024-10-25

### Added

#### Smart User Detection System
- Automatic container user detection with zero configuration
- Intelligent caching by Docker image ID for performance optimization
- Direct container interrogation using `whoami && echo $HOME`
- Universal compatibility with node, ubuntu, python, and custom images
- devcontainer.json `remoteUser` field support with proper priority handling
- XDG-compliant cache storage in `~/.cache/packnplay/userdetect/`

#### Docker-Compatible Port Mapping
- Native `-p/--publish` flag with full Docker syntax compatibility
- Support for multiple port mappings: `-p 8080:3000 -p 9000:9001`
- Complete format support:
  - Basic port mapping: `8080:3000`
  - Host IP binding: `127.0.0.1:8080:3000`
  - Protocol specification: `8080:3000/tcp`, `5353:53/udp`
  - Combined format: `127.0.0.1:8080:3000/tcp`
- Seamless integration with Docker run command arguments

#### Container Management
- Automatic worktree management in XDG-compliant locations
- Dev container discovery with `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json` support
- Persistent container lifecycle with proper labeling
- Container reconnection and attachment capabilities
- Clean container cleanup with `packnplay stop --all`

#### Credential Integration
- Interactive first-run setup with terminal UI
- Secure credential mounting with read-only access
- macOS Keychain integration for automatic credential extraction
- Support for git, SSH, GitHub CLI, GPG, and npm credentials
- Per-invocation credential override flags

#### Development Experience
- Sandboxed execution with host environment isolation
- Clean environment with safe variable whitelisting
- Git integration with proper worktree and repository handling
- Multiple AI agent support (Claude Code, Codex, Gemini, Copilot, Qwen, Cursor, Amp, DeepSeek)
- Environment configuration system with variable substitution

#### Testing and Quality
- Comprehensive test coverage using Test-Driven Development (TDD)
- Integration tests for end-to-end workflows
- User detection caching tests with Docker image verification
- Port mapping compatibility tests across all Docker formats
- Performance testing for optimization verification

### Changed
- Removed "untested and experimental" warning - now production ready
- Updated documentation with comprehensive usage examples
- Enhanced README with new feature descriptions and usage patterns

### Technical Details
- User detection priority: devcontainer.json → cache → runtime detection → fallback
- Port mapping integration through RunConfig to Docker arguments
- Atomic cache writes with corruption prevention
- Image ID-based caching instead of image name caching

### Documentation
- Complete usage guide in README.md
- Release engineering process documentation
- Project-specific Claude Code instructions (CLAUDE.md)
- Comprehensive release notes with examples
